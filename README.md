# Stash - Financial Technology Company 

## Overview and Origin

* Stash 
* Stash Financial, was founded in 2015 
* Originally created by Brandon Krieg, David Ronick & Ed Robinson
* "The idea for Stash came from the weight-loss industry, make it easy to take a small step," says David Ronick, one of the co-founders of IOS & Android app, Stash Financial.  Brandon Krieg, David Ronick & Ed Robinson both come with Wall Street experience. Brandon, David & Ed realized that wealth creation systems (particularly investing) were weighted against everyday Americans. Brandon Krieg’s core focus is finding new ways to simplify financial services industry through technology. Brandon has 20+ years of FinTech industry experience, was co-founder of Edge Trade. Brandon & Ed ultimately left their jobs with a simple mission: “to make investing easy & affordable for everyone.” 

* Stash Financial is funded by 12 investors, with lead investors: Eldrigde & Lending Tree. The most recent investors are Entrée Capital and T. Rowe Price. Stash Financial similarly makes their money from their Stash app monthly subscriptions, ranging from $1 to $9 a month. Stash has received $456m in funding from their 12 Investors. Stash Stock is available to purchase in the private market effective 02/2021 at $37.4777 per share.

## Business Activities:

* Stash Financial objective is to help new investors that get overwhelmed by the millions of stock and funds to invest, by providing ETFs & stocks, run by well-known investment firms like BlackRock, Vanguard & Charles Schwab.  Stash furthermore, wants to teach students about money management and potentially guide the next generation’s desire for day trading, a pastime that soared in popularity during the pandemic.
 
* The type of clientele Stash intendeds to target is:
    - Regular Americans & students
    - Beginners who want to learn how to invest
    - Investors who want to buy fractional shares
    - Investors who want to choose their own investments and get automated portfolios
    - Investors that can only afford partial shares, at the moment. 
* With Stash DIY portfolios, Stash offers access to more than 4,000 individual stocks and ETFs. Stash utilizes fractional shares so that all of their clients’ money is invested. When DIY investors are looking for a particular investment, such as ETFs, Stash organizes ETFs into different categories to help make them easy to find. There are mission-driven portfolio objectives designed to guide users toward investing with their hearts. For example, ‘Clean & Green’ invests in clean energy and ‘Do the Right Thing’ is socially responsible companies. Stash created a tool to educate users about the power of investing. Users can quickly adjust a slider to indicate their monthly deposit and growth potential, or anticipated investment return. Stash app will show how much the user could hypothetically have after one year, five years and 10 years.

* Stash uses the latest security measures to protect its customers, including 256-bit encryption, biometric authentication and other cutting-edge technologies. All Stash accounts come with a bank account serviced by Green Dot Bank, which helps Stash subscribers invest money through automatic investing tools. Allowing their clients to set up a bank account to transfer funds automatically each month into their Stash investment account. 

* Stash customers can choose to have their Stock-Back Card purchases rounded up, with that amount set aside for investing. When you reach $5 in round-ups, it’s automatically moved to the client’s investment portfolio. Deposits to Stash bank accounts are FDIC insured up to the legal limits through a partnership with Green Dot Bank. Investments with Stash are protected up to $500,000 through partner company Apex Clearing Corporation.
 
* Another distinguishing perk of using Stash, is the Stash Stock-Back program, which rewards users as they spend money. All qualifying purchases made with your Stash debit card earn a percentage back in stock. If you make purchases at retailers within Stash’s investing platform, you’ll automatically earn a percentage back from that company’s stock. For other purchases, you’ll get a percentage back in a Stash-approved ETF. Stash offers unlimited trading with no add-on commission fees. The app even analyzes your portfolio and makes investment recommendations based on the clients’ portfolio objective.

## Landscape:

* Stash financial domain, I original thought would be investing. However, through my research I realized the more appropriate domain would be Robo-Advisor Investing 

* The trends Robo-Advisor FinTech companies faced within the last 5-10 years have been, the move beyond basic stock and bond index ETFs have exploded. From active management to niche assets, Robo-Advisors are tapping into every corner of the investment market. More so, hybrid model of human plus Robo-Advisor is taking over. The marriage of robots with humans provides greater business opportunities for existing Robo-Advisor. Sooner or later, Robo-Advisor will need to become more transparent. The modern investment platforms will aid financial advisors with both personalized advice and better FinTech services.

* Some Stash Financial competitors and other major Robo-Advisor Companies, to name a few are: 
    1. SoFi Automated Investing
    2. Wealthfront
    3.  Betterment
    4. Vanguard Digital Advisor
    5. Acorns

## Results

* With more than 343,673 ratings on the App Store and Google Play, Stash earns a spot on Forbes Advisors’ Best Budgeting Apps Of 2021 and has established a solid user base and reputation.

* In June 2021, Stash secured its first company, PayGrade, a financial platform for schools to virtually teach kids around the world finances. Stash already had a financial program called, Stash Learn. Stash and PayGrade will add to the existing education aptitude by expanding PayGrade to help parents teach financial knowledge to their children.
* Stash is exploring an Initial Public Offerings (IPO) and will choose between a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) -merger and an old-fashioned IPO, with the help of advisors from Goldman Sachs. The mixture of capital will help Stash capitalize on the post-pandemic trends of people being more aware of their financial futures and wanting to plan for them. If Stash can continue providing services that attract and retain paying Stashers, then there is the potential for growth. 

* Stash's over 5 million Subscribers was reported in July, 2020. Stash's Assets under Management was reported to be $1b in Apr, 2020. The most common core metrics I found for Robo-Advisors, similar to Stash are: 
	• Amount of Subscribers 
	• Amount of Active Accounts
	• Assets Under Management (AUM)
	• Users

* Stash Financial shines in its own way from other competitors by DIY and automated investing, offering fractional shares and Values-based investment offerings. Stash app score is a 4 stars out of 5. Stash minimum investment allowed is $5. 
*The Cons within Stash from other competitors would be, their Smart Portfolios do no offer tax-loss harvesting and no automated IRA management. Stash fees range from $1-$9, were other competitor fees are 0% to 0.25% of management fees and no human advice. 

## Recommendations
* If I were to advise any products or services to Stash Financial, I would suggest to market more human touch advice, or to add virtual teaching webinar’s or tailored chat options for their clients’, more so the students they target.  

* Like stated within this case study, the future of Robo-Advisors moving more towards a human plus Robo-Advisor hybrid model will enhance Stash's targeted clients to educate students & help parents to educate their kids by providing some type of virtual open door to professional advice. This will tailor to the client’s heart in investing and the human touch that most new investor’s still highly need. 

* The technology that would be needed to support this type of hybrid model or this tailored approach, would be something around, a virtual chat system, a database to track trending Q&A’s or easy or seen investor mistakes that would then become the topic of these chats or live blogs. Marketing within FB or LinkedIn to promote this tailored service.
 
* I believe these types of technologies would be beneficial in the starting step to open the virtual door to a more virtual advisor touch. Since the pandemic has brought all services to a more virtual products and becoming more comfortable with virtual connections, which then provides more efficient and accurate services and recommendations to the new investors.
